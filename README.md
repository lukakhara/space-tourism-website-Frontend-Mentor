    State Management: Used React context for shared state across components

    Performance Optimization: Implemented lazy loading for images and route-based code splitting

    Accessibility: Ensured proper focus management and ARIA attributes for screen readers

Future Improvements 🔮

    Add animations between page transitions

    Implement dark/light mode toggle

    Add more interactive elements (3D models of spacecraft)

    Integrate with a space API for real-time data
